# Stripe Payment Integration - Implementation Summary

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. Core Dependencies
- âœ… `stripe` - Stripe Node.js SDK
- âœ… `@stripe/stripe-js` - Stripe JavaScript SDK
- âœ… `@stripe/react-stripe-js` - React components for Stripe

### 2. Backend Infrastructure

#### Stripe Configuration (`src/lib/stripe.ts`)
- Initializes Stripe with API credentials
- Provides utilities for getting API keys and webhook secrets
- Type-safe exports for use throughout the application

#### Checkout Session API (`src/app/api/checkout-session/route.ts`)
- Creates Stripe Checkout sessions
- Supports both **one-time payments** and **recurring subscriptions**
- Handles plan selection and billing cycle options
- Manages optional add-ons (managed hosting)
- Creates or retrieves Stripe customers
- Calculates pricing with tax
- Stores payment metadata for future reference

#### Webhook Handler (`src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)
- Handles 8 Stripe webhook events:
  - `checkout.session.completed` - Creates subscription/updates user plan
  - `customer.subscription.created` - Records new subscription
  - `customer.subscription.updated` - Updates subscription status
  - `customer.subscription.deleted` - Marks subscription as canceled
  - `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Creates invoice record
  - `invoice.payment_failed` - Marks subscription as past_due
  - `payment_intent.succeeded` - Creates invoice for one-time payments
  - `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Logs failed payment

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Updated Checkout Flow (`src/components/forms/checkout-flow.tsx`)
**New Features:**
- **Payment Type Toggle**: Choose between "Pay Once" or "Payment Plan"
- **Billing Cycle Selection**: Monthly or yearly billing
- **Add-on Options**: Optional managed hosting
- **Email & Company Info**: Collect customer details
- **Order Summary**: Real-time price calculation with tax
- **Stripe Integration**: Redirects to Stripe Checkout on submit
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures

#### Enhanced Pricing Display (`src/components/marketing/redesigned-pricing.tsx`)
- Made pricing cards clickable to open checkout modal
- Displays "Subscribe" action button on each plan
- Shows hosting add-on options
- Customization support for custom pricing

### 4. Payment Flow Pages

#### Checkout Success Page (`src/app/checkout-success/page.tsx`)
- Confirms payment was successful
- Explains next steps (confirmation email, onboarding, team meeting)
- Links back to dashboard
- Displays Stripe session ID for reference

#### Checkout Cancel Page (`src/app/checkout-cancel/page.tsx`)
- Explains payment cancellation
- Links back to pricing page
- Provides contact information for support

### 5. Database Integration
The implementation uses existing database schema:

**Users Table Updates:**
- Stores `stripe_customer_id` for each user
- Tracks `plan_id` for current plan

**Subscriptions Table:**
- Stores recurring payment information
- Tracks billing cycle and hosting options
- Updates status from Stripe webhook events
- Maintains subscription metadata

**Invoices Table:**
- Records both one-time payments and recurring invoices
- Links to Stripe invoice IDs for reconciliation
- Tracks payment status

```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. **Set Environment Variables** (REQUIRED)

You need to configure these variables for Stripe to work:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...                    # From Stripe Dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...   # From Stripe Dashboard
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...             # From Stripe Webhooks
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000   # Your app URL
```

**To set these:**
1. Go to project settings
2. Add the environment variables (mark secrets appropriately)
3. Restart the dev server

### 2. **Configure Stripe Account**

1. Sign up at https://stripe.com
2. Get API keys from Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ API keys
3. Set up webhook at Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ Webhooks
4. Point webhook to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`

### 3. **Test Payment Flow**

Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Use any future expiry date
- Use any 3-digit CVC

### 4. **Deploy to Production**

1. Commit all changes
2. Push to production branch
3. Update environment variables in production
4. Update Stripe webhook endpoint to production URL
5. Use production Stripe API keys

## ðŸ“š Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/stripe.ts` | Stripe SDK initialization |
| `src/app/api/checkout-session/route.ts` | Checkout session creation |
| `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` | Webhook event handling |

| `src/app/checkout-success/page.tsx` | Success confirmation |
| `src/app/checkout-cancel/page.tsx` | Cancellation handling |

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: Secret keys are kept in environment variables (server-side only)
2. **Webhook Verification**: All webhooks are signed and verified
3. **PCI Compliance**: Card details are never stored (handled by Stripe)
4. **Customer Data**: Only non-sensitive customer info stored in database
5. **Stripe Customer IDs**: Used to link to Stripe for account management

## ðŸ“ž Support

For any issues with Stripe integration:
1. Check `STRIPE_SETUP.md` for detailed configuration
2. Review Stripe Dashboard logs for webhook events
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Check API endpoint logs for error messages
